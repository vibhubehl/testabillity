# testabillity
For our Data Science for Software Engineering class, at Uvic we decided to replicate the following research:
https://codeocean.com/capsule/7939508/tree/v1

This research paper aims at estimating Testability of software classes used ML. The paper comes up with multiple ML and ensemble ML models to predict testability. The paper uses data of Java classes with more 16000 entries, and over 200 features. 

Our research aimed at recreating the models used in the research paper. Our results were similar to what the paper got. 

The second part of our research was to try other models that paper didn't try and find a better model. Then we looked into Ensemble ML techniques that the paper didn't use to comeup with final model that can give better results.
